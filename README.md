The Workiva Styleguide
======================

This repository is a collection of coding standards implemented by Workiva. They are provided here as a free resource to help other members of the development community, and are always open to suggestions on how they can be improved.

[A Koan](http://thecodelesscode.com/case/94?topic=compromise)

All rules should be followed without exception - except when they shouldnâ€™t.

<blockquote><h3>Do I contradict myself?
Very well, then I contradict myself, I am large,
I contain multitudes.
<cite>- Walt Whitman</cite></h3></blockquote>

Translation: Coding conventions and style guides are a heuristic - use judgement and good taste.
